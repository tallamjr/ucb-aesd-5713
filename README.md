# ðŸ“Ÿ UCB's Advanced Embedded Software Development

Taken as the Advanced Embedded Linux Development Specialization on Coursera.

## Unit 1: Linux System Programming and Introduction to Buildroot

> This course provides an overview of System Programming for the Linux operating
> system, or software which is interfacing directly with the Linux Kernel and C
> library. The basic components of a Linux Embedded System, including kernel and
> root filesystem details are discussed. The Buildroot build system is
> introduced, which students use to build their own custom Embedded Linux system
> through programming assignments.
>
> Linux System Programming and Introduction to Buildroot can also be taken for
> academic credit as ECEA 5305, part of CU Boulderâ€™s Master of Science in
> Electrical Engineering.

## Unit 2: Linux Kernel Programming and Introduction to Yocto Project

> This course provides an introduction to Kernel Driver development for the
> Linux operating system. The Yocto build system is introduced, which students
> use to build their own custom Embedded Linux system through programming
> assignments.
>
> Linux Kernel Programming and Introduction to Yocto Project can also be taken
> for academic credit as ECEA 5306, part of CU Boulderâ€™s Master of Science in
> Electrical Engineering.
>
> This course builds on the assignments and knowledge obtained in the Linux
> System Programming and Introduction to Buildroot, which must be completed
> before starting this course.

## Unit 3: Linux Embedded System Topics and Projects

> This course is used as the capstone in a three course sequence, including
> Linux System Programming and Introduction to Buildroot and Linux Kernel
> Programming and Introduction to Yocto Project. Both of these courses must be
> completed before starting this course.
>
> This course builds on the content in the previous two prerequisite courses to
> develop a final project of your choosing targeting Linux device targeting
> hardware. The final project is delivered using concepts from Agile Scrum.
> Several pertinent, recent, and relevant Embedded System development related
> topics are covered as a part of the course curriculum, which you may
> optionally choose to incorporate into your final project.
>
> Linux Embedded Systems Topics and Projects can also be taken for academic
> credit as ECEA 5307, part of CU Boulderâ€™s Master of Science in Electrical
> Engineering.
